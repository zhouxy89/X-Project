Your data will added to that from other participants, and will be stored in a form such that it is entirely anonymous. Only then may it be shared within our research team. Findings may be reported to others on the aggregate data. While there are no direct benefits to you, we hope to gain more knowledge on how individuals make decisions. There are no risks associated with this study.
