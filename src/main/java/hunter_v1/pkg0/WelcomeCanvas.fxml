The general goal&#10;of this research is to better understand the way that people process information and reach decisions, and how their performance might be best supported with automated systems.&#10;&#10;WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY? The purpose of the research is to investigate underlying processes and characteristics of human cognitive performance.&#10;&#10;WHAT WILL I BE ASKED TO DO? You will be shown information on a computer screen that may include a task like tracking the heading of an object, deciding which of a set of alternatives represents the best choice, remembering lists of words, pictures, or diagrams. You may be asked to do just one task or you may be asked to do several tasks at the same time. In some experiments your performance might be aided by an automated system. This system might highlight information, suggest an option, or hold information for your later use. &#10;&#10;1 Hour Session Version (1 credits)&#10;&#10;This experiment will be conducted in sessions lasting 90 minutes or less. &#10;&#10;CAN MY TAKING PART IN THE STUDY END EARLY? Your participation in this study will end if (a) you are not responding in a serious way, or (b) if you are not on time for your scheduled session.&#10;&#10;WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS?&#10;There are no known risks involved in participation in this project.  It is not possible to identify all potential risks in research procedures, but the researcher(s) have taken reasonable safeguards to minimize any known and potential, but unknown, risks.&#10;&#10;ARE THERE ANY BENEFITS FROM TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY? There are no&#10;direct benefits from participating in this study. However, by virtue of participating, you will gain some insights into the types of techniques being used in current research in cognitive psychology and other areas of psychology.&#10;&#10;DO I HAVE TO TAKE PART IN THE STUDY? Your participation in this research is voluntary.  If you decide to participate in the study, you may withdraw your consent and stop participating at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.&#10; &#10;WHO WILL SEE THE INFORMATION THAT I GIVE?&#10;We will keep private all research records that identify you, to the extent allowed by law.&#10;&#10;Your data will be collected anonymously, and identified and stored using a random subject number.&#10;&#10;You will login to the psychology department server at the end of the study session to receive your research credit, or provide information to verify your participation, but this identifying information is collected entirely separately from the data collected during the actual study. Your responses in the experiment will be combined with information from other people taking part in the study. When we write about the study to share it with other researchers, we will write about the combined information we have gathered. You will not be identified in these written materials. We may publish the results of this study; however, we will keep you name and other identifying information private.&#10;&#10;WILL I RECEIVE ANY COMPENSATION FOR TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY? You&#10;will receive 1 [one] research participation credit for this study.&#10;&#10;WHAT HAPPENS IF I AM INJURED BECAUSE OF THE RESEARCH?  The Colorado&#10;Governmental Immunity Act determines and may limit Colorado State University's legal responsibility if an injury happens because of this study. Claims against the University must be filed within 180 days of the injury.&#10;&#10;WHAT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS? Before you decide whether to accept this invitation to take part in the study, please ask any questions that might come to mind now.  Later, if you have questions about the study, you can contact the investigator, Ben Clegg at benjamin.clegg@colostate.edu.  If you have any questions about your rights as a volunteer in this research, contact CSU IRB at RICRO_IRB@mail.colostate.edu; 970- 491-1553.  We will give you a copy of this consent form to take with you.&#10;&#10;WHAT ELSE DO I NEED TO KNOW?  You will receive a debriefing at the end of your participation in the study.&#10;&#10;Clicking on the button below implies your consent for data on your responses to be collected.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;I AGREE&#10;" wrappingWidth="725.54296875">
